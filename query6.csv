This change is only for PET/SNP/PROD env (Not for QE env).
RN15.5.38 RN will contain ONLY this change, no other changes can be taken along with this change.
 We can deploy this RN onlyafter few hours/days/month after RN15.5.37 is deployed. So, it can be taken in PET/SNP/PROD in next deployment window after RN15.5.37 is deployed. 
Verify if configs are updated post the deployment of RTB pipeline in app-customerbill-acbrimpactevent and app-customerbill-customerbill config maps
** This is the 2nd RN to be released as part ofBSSE-68250","

Special Instruction. As a part of this RN we introduced a single token for the CG url across all env
 
It is always advised to testing team to change the token value whenever they want to connect for different CG
Token NameàD1_TOKEN_CUSTOMER_GRAPH_URL
 
One more boolean token is there if they want to toggle between CG or simulator
Token nameàcustomer-customercust-mock
 
By default this token will checked in as true as in dev env we dont call real cg
But for QE and other env token value should be false if you want to connect to realCG

This US/HF enabled the scenarios tested in US BSSE-70341
 This US should be delivered as on top later HF for testing & production for after PI16 deployment.

This RN deployment should be done during post business hours and make sure there are no pending/inflight immediate payment request or fallout for immediate payment request.
 
Verify if configs are updated post the deployment of RTB pipeline in app-customerbill-billdataextract configmap and cfm-bridge config map
BDE:
 publish V1,V4
 ImmediateInvoiceFinalize.enabled=true
CFM bridge:
 com.amdocs.billing.customerbill.CFMBridge.tmf.async.publish to v1, v4
 BDE.ImmediateInvoiceBE.enabled=true


Please NOTE :

PI16 changes should contain a special note that is for QE as of now.
 It will be taken to SNP/Prod only after PI16 code base goes to production. 
Need to notify Onkar/Prasenjit/Fazeel and other relevant env owners when this RNs are released, so that they can follow the special deployment strategy and not deploy everything at once.
